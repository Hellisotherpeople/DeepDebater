  <div><h2>Debate Topic</h2><p>Resolved: The United States federal government should establish a National Department of Fun</p><h2>Plan</h2><p>Plan: The United States federal government should establish a National Department of Fun tasked with promoting and funding community-based recreational and educational programs that enhance mental health, social cohesion, and educational outcomes.</p><h2>Harm Argument</h2><p>A recent, rigorously conducted 2023 study by Fleischmann et al., published in Learning and Instruction, provides compelling empirical evidence on how uncoordinated educational reforms like detracking—often pursued with good intentions to promote equality—can inadvertently harm students\' academic self-concept, especially those with low and average achievement. Utilizing natural experiment data with a cohort-control design, the study finds that students in detracked, mixed-ability classrooms suffer a significant decline in their academic self-concept due to unfavorable social comparisons with higher-achieving peers. This negative effect is particularly pronounced for low-achieving students, undermining their motivation and likelihood to pursue challenging subjects such as STEM. This evidence is uniquely important because it reveals a specific mechanism—reduced academic self-concept—that leads to poorer educational outcomes despite more inclusive classroom settings. It thus identifies a significant harm within the education system that community-based educational programs promoted by the plan can address by fostering supportive learning environments and motivation. This direct link between academic self-concept and educational achievement is essential for the affirmative\'s argument that the National Department of Fun\'s coordinated programming is needed to remedy motivational deficits and improve educational outcomes in the U.S.</p><h2>Harm Evidence</h2><h4>Detracking disadvantages average and low achieving students—it maintains the same barriers and reduces student motivation</h4><p><strong>Fleischmann et al. 2023</strong> Moritz Fleischmann (Hector Research Institute of Education Sciences and Psychology, University of Tübingen, Germany), Nicolas Hübner (Institute of Education, University of Tübingen, Germany), Benjamin Nagengast (Hector Research Institute of Education Sciences and Psychology, University of Tübingen, Germany; Department of Education and the Brain & Motivation Research Institute (bMRI), Korea University, South Korea), and Ulrich Trautwein (Hector Research Institute of Education Sciences and Psychology, University of Tübingen, Germany). “The dark side of detracking: Mixed-ability classrooms negatively affect the academic self-concept of students with low academic” | Learning and Instruction Vol 86 August 2023 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475223000221 Accessed May 25, 2023 //MI</p><p>The present study went one step further by making use of natural experiment data that made it easier to control for potential selection effects than previous work. More specifically, we tested the competing hypotheses by exploiting natural experiment data from two detracking school reforms, employing a cohort-control design, and comparing pre-detracking student cohorts with same-age post-detracking student cohorts that were similar in composition, thus rendering this comparison less vulnerable to potential selection effects. Very generally, we found that <u>detracking negatively affected the academic self-concept of students with average academic achievement.</u> Furthermore, we found that <u>detracking affected the self-concept of students with <mark>low academic achievement more negatively than</mark> it affected students with <mark>high academic achievement</mark>.</u> More specifically, <u>students with low academic achievement had a lower self-concept in untracked cohorts than in tracked cohorts.</u> However, <u>the self-concept of students with high academic achievement did not differ between the untracked and tracked cohorts.</u> Our results suggest that detracking negatively affects the academic self-concept of students with low academic achievement. Our findings clearly speak against the labeling hypothesis, namely, the assumption that detracking prevents students with low academic achievement from being labeled low-track students, thus increasing their academic self-concept. Instead, our results are in line with BFLPE research that predicted that the self-concept of students with low academic achievement would suffer as a consequence of being exposed to unfavorable social comparisons in mixed-ability classrooms. 4.1. Theoretical contributions In our manuscript, we tested two competing hypotheses. The contrast hypothesis postulates that detracking decreases the academic self-concept of students with low academic achievement, as it exposes this group of students to more high-achieving peers on average, resulting in unfavorable social comparisons (Marsh & Seaton, 2015). The labeling hypothesis posits that detracking increases the academic self-concept of students with low academic achievement, as this group of students is no longer labeled “low-track students” (e.g., Oakes, 1987, 2005). Transferring these predictions into a statistical model, the labeling hypothesis predicts that detracking should have a more positive effect on the academic self-concept of students with low academic achievement than those with high academic achievement. Vice versa, the contrast hypothesis predicts that detracking should have a more negative effect on the academic self-concept of students with low academic achievement than those with high academic achievement. Employing a cohort-control design and comparing the academic self-concept of adjacent student cohorts where one was tracked and the other was not, we found that the reform had a more negative impact on relatively low-achieving students’ academic self-concept, thereby supporting the contrast hypothesis. On a theoretical level, our results have implications for the theoretical foundations of the contrast hypothesis by affirming the importance and power of social comparison processes in general (Festinger, 1954; Frank, 2011) but also for theories that propose that labeling effects outweigh contrast effects in the educational setting (Marsh et al., 2000). Our results also have implications for the theoretical foundations of the labeling hypothesis. For example, our results suggest that if low tracks communicate stigma, this stigma might be communicated to parents or teachers but not the students themselves. Our study also adds to the differentiation-polarization theory (Abraham, 1989) by indicating that some academic outcomes (e.g., academic self-concept) might be differently affected by (de-)segregation practices than, for example, antiacademic attitudes. BFLPE theory states that social comparison processes in which students compare their academic achievement with that of their classmates are one of the decisive determinants of academic self-concept formation. Empirical evidence for BFLPE theory originally came from studies that found that class-average achievement negatively predicts academic self-concept when individual achievement differences are controlled for (for an overview, see Marsh & Seaton, 2015). The finding that equally able students have a lower academic self-concept in high-achieving classrooms has been interpreted as the consequence of social comparison processes. This traditional research on the BFLPE has often been criticized for its homogeneity of methodology by almost exclusively relying on cross-sectional multilevel data, often stemming from international large-scale assessments, such as PISA or TIMSS (e.g., Dai, 2004; Dai & Rinn, 2008). Many such allegations have meanwhile been addressed (Marsh et al., 2004, 2008), and today, there are many longitudinal (Marsh et al., 2016) but also quasi-experimental studies (Loyalka et al., 2018) that support the BFLPE theory. The BFLPE can be applied to make predictions about situations in which students are exposed to a change in achievement-related class composition. For example, such changes can occur on the individual (e.g., grade retention) or collective level (e.g., policy reforms). Related to this point, researchers have criticized the cross-sectional BFLPE model for its “static” nature and have called for more “dynamic” tests of its predictions (e.g., Dai & Rinn, 2008; Wouters et al., 2012). Our study addressed this point by testing the implications of the BFLPE that concern educational systems in a “real-life” setting, thereby adding to research that focuses on real-world implications of the frame-of-reference effect. Leaving the traditional BFLPE methodology behind and using natural experiment data, our study provides renewed evidence for the remarkable robustness of the frame-of-reference effect. Next to presenting a dynamic test of the BFLPE in general, our study is also in line with a body of research that found that positive assimilation effects (e.g., resulting from being a member of a prestigious learning environment) were outweighed by negative contrast effects (e.g., Chmielewski et al., 2013; Marsh et al., 2000; Trautwein et al., 2009). Our study complements the tracking literature that has extensively investigated the effects of tracking on student achievement and has typically found mixed results (e.g., Betts, 2011; Duflo et al., 2011; Matthewes, 2021). More specifically, our study is a reminder that detracking school reforms can have unintended side effects on student motivation. There are reasons to believe that only when such negative side effects are reduced or eliminated can detracking school reforms unfold their full potential in establishing educational equality in terms of academic achievement. Furthermore, our results are not in line with research that has suggested that tracking practices lead to “labels” that yield a higher academic self-concept in high-track students as opposed to low-track students (see Oakes, 1987, 2005). In fact, the results of our study seem to indicate that any such differences might be caused by selection rather than labeling effects. Hence, our study also indicates that future research on possible contrast or labeling effects should always control for selection effects. What do our study results, which support the contrast hypothesis, mean for disadvantaged student groups, such as ethnic minority students, students with a migration background, or students coming from families with low socioeconomic status? As we stated in the Introduction, these groups of students have been assumed to be disproportionally represented in the lower tracks (e.g., Loveless, 1999; Lucas, 1999), and the reasons for this assumption are manifold. Some of these students might indeed show lower academic achievement, probably because they lack parental support, whereas other students might have been placed in the lower tracks because of teachers’ biased expectations or parental choices. Independently of the reason for this overrepresentation of disadvantaged student groups in the lower tracks, detracking will expose them to more high-achieving peers. This exposure, on average, will likely result in a lower academic self-concept for these groups of students. For us, this is not a general argument against detracking but a cautious note that detracking practices can come along with unintended side effects that must be addressed. Next to research on the BFLPE, our work also contributes to previous studies that have investigated differential detracking effects for boys and girls (e.g., Hübner et al., 2017; Hübner et al., 2019). These studies have shown that detracking more negatively affects the self-concept of girls than boys. The authors suspect that this effect results from girls more often being enrolled in basic courses and thus more often experiencing an increase in class-average achievement as a consequence of detracking. Our work extended these previous studies by explicitly testing and finding confirmation for the assumption that students with low academic achievement—those who are enrolled in the low track within tracked systems—experience more negative detracking effects as opposed to students with high academic achievement. Our study also indicates that detracking negatively affected the academic self-concept of students with average academic achievement—although this negative effect was not as pronounced as the effect on students with low academic achievement. One explanation for this finding is that, after both reforms<mark>, <u>all students were taught the curriculum that had been reserved for high-track students </mark>before the reform.</u> To the extent that the majority of students in the pre-reform cohort did not attend the high track, <u>the curriculum standards were raised for the majority of students, thus explaining the main effect of cohort. </u>In Studies 1 and 2, different course-by-course tracking systems were abolished. The pre-reform cohort in Study 1 experienced “achievement tracking” in which track assignment is primarily based on prior achievement. The pre-reform cohort in Study 2 experienced “opt-in tracking” in which track assignment is primarily based on students’ choices. It is interesting to see that these different forms of course-by-course tracking apparently resulted in different variance partition coefficients in achievement at the class level. In Study 1 in which students were more strictly grouped according to ability, the proportion of variance on the class level was higher than in Study 2, in which this was not the case. The different forms of course-by-course tracking employed in the two studies could also be an explanation for the different effect sizes of the differential reform effects for lower and higher achieving students. In Study 1, in which there was a very strict separation of students from different ability levels before the reform, the abolishment of ability grouping may have increased the “shock” for students with low academic achievement, as opposed to in Study 2, in which there may have been less of a strict separation before the reform. Additionally, in our paper, we investigated course-by-course (de-)tracking. Thus, pre-reform students were tracked in some subjects and attended mixed-ability classrooms in others. Theoretically, it can be assumed that in systems with stricter tracking (e.g., within-school streaming, between-school tracking), students with low academic achievement have a higher academic self-concept (as compared with less strictly separated systems) because of more favorable social comparison processes. As a consequence, the negative effect of detracking on the academic self-concept of students with low academic achievement should be even more negative when strict tracking systems are abolished. 4.2. Implications for educational practice Our study has several implications for educational practice. First and foremost, it reminds educational policymakers that <u><strong><mark>detracking comes at the expense of the academic self-concept</u></strong></mark> of students with low academic achievement, and academic self-concept is an important motivational variable that affects educational choices and academic achievement (Marsh et al., 2017). More specifically, detracking school reforms are often conducted in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; Domina & Saldana, 2012). Detracking in STEM areas is often conducted to homogenize student achievement in those specific subjects and, consequently, to provide equal career chances for all students. Our study shows that this calculation might not necessarily pay off. As academic self-concept is a decisive determinant of occupational aspirations and choices (Eccles, 2009), <u><mark>detracking</mark> may <mark>prevent students with low academic achievement from pursuing a STEM career.</u></mark> For example, <u>a student with low academic achievement in an untracked system will have a lower self-concept compared with what they would have in a tracked system, <mark>and</mark> it will be <mark>more likely</mark> for such a student <mark>to decide not to study mathematics</mark>.</u> There is a widely held belief that detracking reduces educational inequalities (B. Rubin, 2006). However, empirical evidence on this issue has not been consistent (Betts, 2011). By showing that detracking negatively affects the academic self-concept of students with low academic achievement, our study emphasizes that <u>in order to unfold the full potential of detracking in establishing educational equality, it is indispensable to investigate how practices of tracking and detracking impact student motivation.</u> Our study\'s practical implication is that researchers and practitioners have to find ways to reduce the negative side effects of detracking that may result from social comparison processes. However, to date, studies that have searched for possible classroom-level moderators of the BFLPE were not successful (Lüdtke et al., 2005; Marsh et al., 2021). Another way to counteract the negative side effects of detracking school reforms described in this study might be to provide self-referenced performance feedback (Marsh & Craven, 2002). Although this idea might be appealing at first glance, empirical results have not supported its effectiveness: Fleischmann et al. (2021) found that a school reform that abolished class-referenced grading was not able to reduce the BFLPE.</p></div>\n<div><h2>Inherency Argument</h2><p>Federal support for environmental education and related STEM educational programs is minimal and lacks comprehensive coordination. The U.S. Department of Education has been largely absent in these efforts, leading to fragmentation and insufficient reach to address academic motivation and educational outcomes, especially in underserved communities. The report highlights that only through federal leadership and establishment of a coordinated policy and funding mechanism can such educational disparities and motivation-related harms be addressed, which the plan proposes to do by creating a National Department of Fun.</p><h2>Inherency Evidence</h2><h4>Federal Coordination key to equal access, efficient funding, teacher training, STEM, and cooperative federalism</h4><p><strong>Stek 2011</strong> (Charles A. Stek, Policy Director for the No Child Left Inside Coalition, 2011. The Case for AN executive order on Environmental Literacy, http://www.mielp.org/uploads/2/4/0/3/24036181/a_case_for_executive_order_on_environmental_literacy_-_ncli_coalition_white_paper.pdf</p><p><u><strong><mark>Federal Leadership Is Needed and Crucial</u></strong></mark> <u><strong><mark>federal support</u></strong></mark> for environmental education in both policy and funding <u><strong><mark>is woefully inadequate</u></strong></mark> </p><p>Today some <u><strong>14</u></strong> Federal <u><strong>agencies</u></strong> <u><strong>administer</u></strong> a wide range of formal and informal <u><strong>environmental</u></strong> or environmentally-related (energy, conservation, natural resource, or outdoor) <u><strong>education programs</u></strong> or activities aligned to each agency’s separate missions. <u><strong><mark>There is large variation in the kinds of environmental education initiatives offered</u></strong></mark> and in the goals, amounts of funding assistance provided, <u><strong>and the audiences served</u></strong> by the programs. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manage the primary federal grant programs supporting both formal and informal environmental education. These programs, authorized under the National Environmental Education Act of 1990 and the America Competes Act, respectively, work to improve understanding and stewardship of the environment. The programs provide important assistance to a broad array of audiences, including K–12 students, teachers, post-secondary and graduate students, and the general public. Additionally, a dozen other federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Interior, and Energy, NASA, and the National Science Foundation, support research fellowships, web-based and other educational tools, curriculum development, internships, awards, studies, or other programs that are directly or indirectly related to environmental, sustainability, or energy education. Many of these programs are focused at higher education audiences.</p><p> <u><strong><mark>Federal support for all these programs is limited</u></strong></mark> and serves only a relatively small portion of the population. In Fiscal 2010, EPA awarded $3.4 million and NOAA awarded approximately $17 million in competitive grants through each respective agency’s environmental education programs. EPA estimates that each year, the agency’s environmental education grants reach 50,000 students, 6,000 teachers, and 100,000 in the general public. NOAA estimates that grants awarded under the agency’s Fiscal 2010 Bay Watershed Education and Training Program reached 57,000 students and more than 2,400 teachers nationally. NOAA grants to aquariums awarded under the agency’s Fiscal 2009 Environmental Literacy Grants Program reach more than 11 million visitors annually. While these grants are only a snapshot and do not represent the total reach of the agencies’ environmental education programs and activities, they do provide a sense of the relative scale. With the U.S. population now exceeding 300 million, including approximately 77 million pre-K–20 students and more than 3.6 million K–12 teachers, clearly much more needs to be done to achieve environmental literacy goals. </p><p>Moreover, <u><strong><mark>these programs and initiatives are not well integrated into federal education or other goals nor are part of a comprehensive, coordinated education policy that supports state and local education systems</u></strong></mark>. To date, <u><strong><mark>the U.S. Department of Education</mark>—the agency that</u></strong> “establishes policy for, administers and <u><strong>coordinates most federal assistance to education” —<mark>has been “mostly absent”</mark> from efforts to educate students about the environment</u></strong> and prepare them to participate in a sustainable economy, according to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the Department of Education’s policies under the No Child Left Behind Act have had the unintended consequences of actually discouraging state and local environmental education programs and valuable hands-on field experiences previously carried out in many schools and school districts throughout the nation. To his credit, the Secretary Duncan has recognized this deficiency and, as part of the Blueprint for Reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, has included environmental education in a new competitive grant program to promote a “well-rounded education.” The new program proposes approximately $250 million in grants to states, high-need districts, and non-profit partners to strengthen the teaching and learning of a variety of subjects, including American history, civics, foreign languages, the arts, financial literacy, and—for the first time—environmental education. It is an important step forward in increasing the support, participation, and cooperation by the U.S. Department of Education to help enhance environmental literacy—but only a step. </p><p><u><strong><mark>Leadership by the Secretary of Education</u></strong></mark>, the Secretary of Interior, and other Administration cabinet and sub-cabinet agencies <u><strong><mark>is</u></strong></mark> also <u><strong><mark>needed to ensure a cohesive, coordinated environmental literacy policy</mark> across the Federal government</u></strong> that supports not only stewardship goals, but national education, workforce development, outdoor education, healthy kids/healthy adults, energy, and economic sustainability goals. Strategies must be developed to leverage the unique capabilities of each Federal agency carrying out environmental education programs and activities and to encourage and support state efforts to develop and implement environmental literacy plans. Such <u><strong><mark>a coordinated environmental literacy policy would</u></strong></mark>: </p><p>• Help <u><strong><mark>ensure that federal funding is spent efficiently</u></strong></mark> to support the education, environmental, economic sustainability and workforce-develop goals listed above; </p><p>• <u><strong><mark>Ensure that environmental education is effectively and fully integrated into the curriculum</u></strong></mark> and with other efforts to improve student performance across disciplines;</p><p> • <u><strong><mark>Ensure that environmental education programs reach all students regardless of their income, race, ethnic or language background, or disability status</u></strong></mark>; • Help to <u><strong><mark>expand the academic pipeline for STEM</u></strong></mark>-related subjects; </p><p>• <u><strong><mark>Ensure that educators have the required skills and training</u></strong></mark> to teach environmental education content; <u><mark>and</u></mark> </p><p>• <u><strong><mark>Preserve states’ authority to determine their environmental education curriculum</u></strong></mark>.</p></div>\n<h2>Advantage 1: Enhancement of Mental Health and Academic Motivation through Coordinated Community Programs</h2>\n<div><p>The establishment of a National Department of Fun would directly address current inadequacies in mental health resources within educational settings, especially in high-poverty communities. By promoting coordinated recreational and educational programs, it would mitigate motivational harms caused by unstructured detracking reforms that diminish academic self-concept among low and average achieving students. Federal investment in evidence-based, school-linked mental health services supports positive school climates, reduces risky behaviors, and improves learning outcomes, thereby fulfilling a crucial gap in current educational support structures.</p></div>\n<h2>Advantage 1 Uniqueness</h2>\n<div><p>According to Young Mind Advocacy (2016), government investment in school-linked mental health programs is insufficient and fragmented across multiple agencies. Teachers are uniquely positioned to intervene but face significant barriers including limited training and overwhelmed mental health providers. Expanded School Mental Health programs are promising but underfunded and lack coordination, limiting their reach especially in underserved communities. This demonstrates the current non-inevitability of effective, coordinated federal recreational and mental health programming for youth, underscoring the affirmative\'s argument for establishing a National Department of Fun to address this gap.</p></div>\n<div><p><h4>However, the government consistently turns their back to this crisis.

This demonstrates that federal coordination via the plan will lead to enhanced school-linked mental health services, improving student mental health and academic motivation as claimed in Advantage 1.</p></div>\n<div><p><h4>It is empirically proven that categorical grants solve and lead to local implementation.</h4><p><strong>Nicole Cammock</strong>, <strong>Licensed Clinical Psychologist at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, writes in 2014</strong> – Nicole, Licensed Clinical Psychologist at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “Funding Expanded School Mental Health Programs” https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-7624-5_2</p><p>At the local level, <u>school districts have the power to determine what mental health services are funded and can allocate funds toward programs that treat mental health disorders within the school setting</u>. <u><strong><mark>Local</mark> revenue <mark>funds are</mark> typically <mark>limited</u></strong></mark> because they are intended to support basic school components. Bershad and Blaber ( 2011 ) note, however, that local funding may be more easily accessed if funders are provided with evidence of the association between student mental health and academic outcomes. <u><mark>School district revenues can</mark> either <mark>be</mark> general revenue (i.e., for any educational purpose) <strong>or <mark>categorical</mark> revenue</strong> </u>(i.e., targeted for specifi c purposes). <u><strong>Categorical revenues are <mark>intended</mark> <mark>to increase</mark> educational <mark>resources for specifi c student populations</mark> in need of supplemental services</u></strong>. Because <u>local revenues for education are typically lower in school districts with higher levels of poverty, <strong>categorical funding can be <mark>utilized</mark> as an important mechanism <mark>to fund ESMH programs</mark> to at-risk youth</u></strong> (Poirier & Osher, 2006 ). Solicited Funds A signifi cant private funding source of school mental health programs is foundation support (Weist, Evans, & Lever, 2003 ) because they can provide supplemental and often less restrictive support (e.g., more fl exibility for the provision of mental health promotion and prevention-related services) and resources to ESMH programs (Evans et al., 2003 ). For example, the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati (https://www. healthfoundation.org/) funds the implementation of mental health prevention programs in schools, and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Foundation in South Carolina provides seed grants to help supplement school mental health clinician salaries in an effort to retain clinicians in areas with budget shortages (Freeman, 2011 ). However, many traditional organizations such as The Duke Endowment, (http://www.dukeendowment.org/), which in the past provided funding to support planning and start-up costs associated with school-based mental health centers, have experienced a decline in assets resulting in a limited ability to fund new grants (North Carolina School Psychology Association, 2011 ). <u>Coordinating Funding Streams To combat the diffi culties associated with securing funding and the challenge of any one source having the means to cover all fi nancial expenses to support ESMH services, many programs seek funding from multiple funding streams. </u>This helps ensure that programs receive adequate funding to supplement the costs associated with providing mental health services in schools and helps protect against a program being overwhelmed and needing to shut down if the funding source is cut. For example, fi ndings from a comprehensive <u>assessment of the New Hampshire’s school mental health system suggest that the state utilizes funding from multiple sources,</u> successfully <u>integrates Medicaid services with IDEAfunded services</u>, and has partnerships between the school districts and community health centers (Norton & Tappin, 2009 ). Two common strategies to combine multiple funding streams are braided funding and blended funding . <u>Braided funding involves coordinating multiple funding streams that were initially separate to pay for services provided by a given program. Under braided funding, ESMH programs N.L. Cammack et al. 21 must maintain the separate budgets of each funding stream and carefully detail how funds from each stream were utilized</u> (Bershad & Blaber, 2011 ; Mauery, Vaquerano, Sethi, Jee, & Chimento, 2006 ). This can be administratively challenging to ensure that each funding stream is only paying for activities eligible under that funding stream. ESMH programs that utilize braided funding may risk becoming “locked” into providing specifi c types of services on the continuum, as dictated by contract requirements (Poirier & Osher, 2006 ). For example, programs that rely on third-party reimbursements may have limited time to provide universal or targeted prevention services if specifi ed by braided funding sources (Center for School Mental Health, 2003 ). <u><strong><mark>Blended funding involves</mark> combining <mark>funds from multiple</mark> funding <mark>streams</mark> into a single budget. ESMH programs are able to allocate funds to provide services without the need to track and report back to funders which funding stream paid for exactly which services and expenses</u></strong> (Mauery et al., 2006 ; Poirier & Osher, 2006 ). The benefi t to blended funding is that <u><mark>administrative reporting may be less burdensome</mark> than in braided models, and all funders are supporting the same overarching deliverables and program goals</u>. However, it should be noted that some funding mechanisms may not allow for the blending of funds. Examples of Sustained Funding of ESMH Programs Washington, DC Commission In 1999, 17 <u>public charter schools in Washington, DC were awarded the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative grant to implement a comprehensive violence prevention initiative. </u>Through the SS/HS Initiative grant, <u><mark>the Washington, DC</mark> Department of Mental Health was subcontracted to develop a school-based mental health program to implement in 16 public charter schools who were recipients of the grant</u> (Price & Leah, 2008 ). An additional 18 schools were added to the grant during the 2005–2006 academic year. The DC Department of Mental Health utilized the ESMH framework (Weist, 1997 ) as a model to develop their school mental health program (SMHP). The SMHP provides prevention, early intervention, and treatment services through three targeted levels of care: primary prevention (universal prevention services), secondary prevention (selective prevention services), and tertiary prevention (indicated prevention services). Since 2003, the Washington, DC Commission has successfully sustained funding for its school mental health services. The DC school mental health programs are predominantly funded by local dollars from the city government that is given to the DC Department of Mental Health and utilizes a very small percentage of their budget from fee-for-service (for treatment services) revenue. In the 2011–2012 academic year, school mental health services are being provided by the DC Commission with 43 clinicians across 13 charter schools and 41 public schools in Washington, DC. <u><strong>This <mark>project demonstrates the value of using federal grant dollars as a foundation to</mark> build, <mark>implement</mark>, and document the impact of <mark>a</mark> <mark>program</mark>.</u></strong> <u>The documented successes with the project and the relationships formed as part of the work helped to build buy-in and needed programmatic and fi nancial support from the local government and community when the federal grant had ended</u>. Boys Town South Florida One example of how funding has been secured for social, emotional, and behavioral health services for young children and their families in schools is found in Florida. Boys Town South Florida (www. boystown.org/south-fl orida) implements two programs in Palm Beach County: School & Family Support Services (SFSS) and Primary Project. The SFSS program provides in- school and inhome services to children in 70 elementary schools. Primary Project is an evidence- based program developed by the Children’s Institute and provides child-led play sessions in 12 elementary schools in the county. Both programs are primarily funded through local tax dollars that are collected by an independent, special taxing district, which is set up as a quasi-governmental entity. The funding organization has a local board that sets Funding Expanded School Mental Health Programs 22 funding priorities and oversees the distribution of funds, as well as monitors for child and system level outcomes. In addition, services provided within the SFSS program can be eligible for reimbursement under a state-authorized Medicaid carve-out plan for the at-risk population. Under this plan, the child needs to be at-risk for child abuse or neglect, as evidenced by a variety of risk factors. Baltimore, Maryland: Expanded School Mental Health Network Baltimore City is well recognized for its 23-year history of providing comprehensive mental health services in City Schools and its 10-year history of providing mental health services in City Head Start Centers. In 2011, the Expanded School Mental Health (ESMH) clinicians served 89 City Schools, and Early Childhood Mental Health (ECMH) clinicians served 14 Head Start Centers. The <u>expanded school mental health network has relied on a blended funding model</u> that has pooled and leveraged funding from multiple agencies and programs including the City Schools, Baltimore Mental Health Systems, Inc. (the local core service agency for the state mental health authority), Baltimore Substance Abuse Systems, Inc. (the substance abuse authority for Baltimore City), Baltimore City Health Department, the Family League of Baltimore (a quasi-governmental nonprofi t organization that works with a range of partners to develop and implement initiatives that improve the well-being of Baltimore’s children, youth, and families), and the Department of Labor. <u>The funders for the project have worked together as part of the leadership team of ESMH to establish funding guidelines, deliverable requirements for ESMH clinicians, an online statistical reporting system, and clear expectations</u> for principals receiving services within their schools. The ESMH network in Baltimore City demonstrates the value of leveraging dollars and the importance of defi ning and documenting service provision and student- level outcomes (see Weist, Paternite, Wheatley- Rowe, & Gall, 2009 ). Implications of Health Reform State and <u><strong><mark>federal legislation is critical in determining</mark> the <mark>funding and coordination</mark> <mark>of</mark> integrated <mark>mental health services</mark> for children and adolescents in schools</u></strong>. For instance, at the state level, the Mental Health Services Act in California (also known at Proposition 63) gave the Department of Mental Health the authorization to establish guidelines and fund the implementation of prevention and early intervention activities and workforce education and training throughout the state (California Department of Mental Health, 2004 ). Under Title V of the District of Columbia’s Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007, an Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission was created to foster collaboration between agencies to promote social and emotional skills among children and youth. Specifi cally this integrated system focused on using data to identify and assess youth that receive services through various agencies in Washington, DC, provide evidence-based programs, and evaluate the results (Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 , 2007). As such the commission is eligible to combine local, federal, and other resources to provide multidisciplinary assessments, integrated services, and evidence- based programs to youth and receive and disburse federal, state, and local funds to provide funding to at-risk children, youth, and families (Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 , 2007). At the federal level, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act [ACA], 2010 ), also known as national healthcare reform, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. Over the course of a decade, the ACA intends to expand health and mental health services to a larger population and make health insurance coverage more affordable. Specifi cally, ACA increases Medicaid coverage eligibility to younger children (i.e., under age 6 living in families with incomes at or below 133 % of poverty), youth in foster care, and children with preexisting N.L. Cammack et al. 23 medical conditions and provides grant funding to integrate mental health services and expand mental health prevention. ACA affords more children and adolescents access to behavioral health outreach, screening, assessment, and intervention (ACA, 2010 ; Children’s Health Fund, 2011 ; Cunningham, Grimm, Evangelista, Lever, & Stephan, 2012 ). The ACA also preserved CHIP, which provides medical insurance coverage to children from low-income families who are not eligible for Medicaid and cannot afford health insurance. The CHIP Act of 2009 authorized funding of school-based health centers within schools to increase student access to health and mental health services. Since the ACA law passed, $95 million has been awarded to fund school-based health centers (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011 ). <u><mark>Legislation that <strong>supports</mark> the <mark>funding of grants</mark> and programs <mark>that provide ESMH </mark>services and other mental health interventions <mark>expand</mark> mental health <mark>services to vulnerable and underserved populations</strong></mark>, further highlighting the importance of school mental health professionals working with legislators</u> and advocating for the funding of integrated comprehensive mental health services for children and adolescents in schools. Steps Needed to Fund School Mental Health Programs <u>Expanded school mental health programs continue to face numerous challenges with sustaining funding to provide mental health services,</u> prevention and intervention efforts, and targeted services that reduce the impact of mental illnesses on child and adolescent functioning in schools. <u>To meet this challenge and to help sustain ESMH services, programs must <strong>identify ways to enlarge their funding pool</strong>.</u> Specifi cally, conducting a full comprehensive examination of existing funding opportunities at the national, state, and local levels for grants, contracts, feefor- service payments, interagency agreements, etc., can result in identifi cation of funding streams that were not previously utilized by ESMH programs. It is possible to pool multiple block grant funds together to support ESMH programs. For instance, the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, Social Services Block Grant, Juvenile Accountability Block Grant, Education Block Grant, Early Childhood Block Grant, and Community Development Block Grant are examples of block grants that support early intervention mental health services provided by ESMH programs. It is also important to analyze education funds at the national, state, and local levels to determine the availability of funding for nonacademic learning supports such as ESMH programs. For example, prior research has shown that students who receive mental health services and prevention and intervention programs through school-based services are more likely to achieve in school (Greenberg et al., 2003 ; Welsh et al., 2001 ; Zins et al., 2004 ), reduce special education referrals and improve school climate (Bruns et al., 2004 ; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2005 ), decrease grade retention ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ), and reduce levels of emotional and behavioral diffi culties (Hussey & Guo, 2003 ). Thus, the positive academic and emotional outcomes associated with school-based mental health services may qualify many ESMH programs for educational grants that support nonacademic learning supports. In addition, <u>it is benefi cial for ESMH programs to align goals with education priorities and explore the possibilities for direct education funding for mental health promotion and early intervention</u>. For example, in the states of Ohio and North Carolina, <u><strong>federal education funds have been used to support the implementation of evidence-based programs and interventions</u></strong> (Price & Lear, 2008 ). Examples of <u><strong><mark>federal educational supports include Title I</u></strong> (</mark>Part D: Children and Youth who are Neglected Delinquent or At-Risk), <u><strong><mark>Title IV</u></strong></mark> (Part A: Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities; Part B: T wenty-First Century Community Learning Centers), <u><strong><mark>and Title V</u></strong></mark> (Promoting Informed Parental Choice and Innovative Programs). In addition, <u><strong>the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act designates a portion of the special education budget to provide intervention services</u></strong> Funding Expanded School Mental Health Programs 24 to youth who have not qualifi ed for special education services yet, making it possible to fund early intervention work through ESMH programs. <u><mark>Expanded school mental health programs</mark> are also encouraged to develop relationships with other agencies</u> (e.g., community mental health centers) or professionals (e.g., child psychiatrists) <u><strong>who <mark>can access categorical funding</strong></mark> that many ESMH programs are not eligible to receive</u>. Through this partnership, <u>ESMH programs and other outpatient agencies can work together to develop and create a full continuum of integrated mental health services for students</u>. For example, Price and Lear ( 2008 ) suggested that an ESMH program that is not eligible for Medicaid funding can develop a relationship with a Medicaid certified provider who can bill for Medicaid services provided to Medicaid-eligible students.</p></p></div>\n<h2>Advantage 1 Internal Link</h2>\n<div><p>Licensed clinical psychologist Nicole Cammock from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs empirically establishes that federal categorical grants are instrumental in enabling local school districts, especially in impoverished areas, to fund, sustain, and expand Expanded School Mental Health programs. She highlights the use of braided and blended funding methods that facilitate stable implementation. This expert testimony confirms the causal link within the plan’s framework from federal coordination and funding to improved, sustainable school-linked mental health services that boost student mental health and academic motivation, as asserted in advantage 1.</p></div>\n<div><p><h4>It is empirically proven that categorical grants solve and lead to local implementation.</h4><p><strong>Nicole Cammock</strong>, <strong>Licensed Clinical Psychologist at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, writes in 2014</strong> – Nicole, Licensed Clinical Psychologist at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “Funding Expanded School Mental Health Programs” https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-7624-5_2</p><p>At the local level, <u>school districts have the power to determine what mental health services are funded and can allocate funds toward programs that treat mental health disorders within the school setting</u>. <u><strong><mark>Local</mark> revenue <mark>funds are</mark> typically <mark>limited</u></strong></mark> because they are intended to support basic school components. Bershad and Blaber ( 2011 ) note, however, that local funding may be more easily accessed if funders are provided with evidence of the association between student mental health and academic outcomes. <u><mark>School district revenues can</mark> either <mark>be</mark> general revenue (i.e., for any educational purpose) <strong>or <mark>categorical</mark> revenue</strong> </u>(i.e., targeted for specifi c purposes). <u><strong>Categorical revenues are <mark>intended</mark> <mark>to increase</mark> educational <mark>resources for specifi c student populations</mark> in need of supplemental services</u></strong>. Because <u>local revenues for education are typically lower in school districts with higher levels of poverty, <strong>categorical funding can be <mark>utilized</mark> as an important mechanism <mark>to fund ESMH programs</mark> to at-risk youth</u></strong> (Poirier & Osher, 2006 ). Solicited Funds A signifi cant private funding source of school mental health programs is foundation support (Weist, Evans, & Lever, 2003 ) because they can provide supplemental and often less restrictive support (e.g., more fl exibility for the provision of mental health promotion and prevention-related services) and resources to ESMH programs (Evans et al., 2003 ). For example, the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati (https://www. healthfoundation.org/) funds the implementation of mental health prevention programs in schools, and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Foundation in South Carolina provides seed grants to help supplement school mental health clinician salaries in an effort to retain clinicians in areas with budget shortages (Freeman, 2011 ). However, many traditional organizations such as The Duke Endowment, (http://www.dukeendowment.org/), which in the past provided funding to support planning and start-up costs associated with school-based mental health centers, have experienced a decline in assets resulting in a limited ability to fund new grants (North Carolina School Psychology Association, 2011 ). <u>Coordinating Funding Streams To combat the diffi culties associated with securing funding and the challenge of any one source having the means to cover all fi nancial expenses to support ESMH services, many programs seek funding from multiple funding streams. </u>This helps ensure that programs receive adequate funding to supplement the costs associated with providing mental health services in schools and helps protect against a program being overwhelmed and needing to shut down if the funding source is cut. For example, fi ndings from a comprehensive <u>assessment of the New Hampshire’s school mental health system suggest that the state utilizes funding from multiple sources,</u> successfully <u>integrates Medicaid services with IDEAfunded services</u>, and has partnerships between the school districts and community health centers (Norton & Tappin, 2009 ). Two common strategies to combine multiple funding streams are braided funding and blended funding . <u>Braided funding involves coordinating multiple funding streams that were initially separate to pay for services provided by a given program. Under braided funding, ESMH programs N.L. Cammack et al. 21 must maintain the separate budgets of each funding stream and carefully detail how funds from each stream were utilized</u> (Bershad & Blaber, 2011 ; Mauery, Vaquerano, Sethi, Jee, & Chimento, 2006 ). This can be administratively challenging to ensure that each funding stream is only paying for activities eligible under that funding stream. ESMH programs that utilize braided funding may risk becoming “locked” into providing specifi c types of services on the continuum, as dictated by contract requirements (Poirier & Osher, 2006 ). For example, programs that rely on third-party reimbursements may have limited time to provide universal or targeted prevention services if specifi ed by braided funding sources (Center for School Mental Health, 2003 ). <u><strong><mark>Blended funding involves</mark> combining <mark>funds from multiple</mark> funding <mark>streams</mark> into a single budget. ESMH programs are able to allocate funds to provide services without the need to track and report back to funders which funding stream paid for exactly which services and expenses</u></strong> (Mauery et al., 2006 ; Poirier & Osher, 2006 ). The benefi t to blended funding is that <u><mark>administrative reporting may be less burdensome</mark> than in braided models, and all funders are supporting the same overarching deliverables and program goals</u>. However, it should be noted that some funding mechanisms may not allow for the blending of funds. Examples of Sustained Funding of ESMH Programs Washington, DC Commission In 1999, 17 <u>public charter schools in Washington, DC were awarded the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative grant to implement a comprehensive violence prevention initiative. </u>Through the SS/HS Initiative grant, <u><mark>the Washington, DC</mark> Department of Mental Health was subcontracted to develop a school-based mental health program to implement in 16 public charter schools who were recipients of the grant</u> (Price & Leah, 2008 ). An additional 18 schools were added to the grant during the 2005–2006 academic year. The DC Department of Mental Health utilized the ESMH framework (Weist, 1997 ) as a model to develop their school mental health program (SMHP). The SMHP provides prevention, early intervention, and treatment services through three targeted levels of care: primary prevention (universal prevention services), secondary prevention (selective prevention services), and tertiary prevention (indicated prevention services). Since 2003, the Washington, DC Commission has successfully sustained funding for its school mental health services.

The <u>before-school, afterschool and summer settings (known collectively as <strong>afterschool) play a valuable role</strong> in closing the opportunity gap facing many children and youth from underserved and underrepresented communities</u>. Of the 8.4 million children currently in afterschool programs, ethnic minority children are more likely than others to participate.i Twenty-five percent of Asian, 24 percent of African-American, 21 percent of Hispanic and 16 percent of Native American children attend afterschool programs, compared to the national average of 15 percent. Girls attend afterschool programs in equal numbers to boys. <u><strong><mark>Afterschool is the ideal setting to reach the populations the country needs to widen the STEM-pipeline through experiences that supplement and complement the school day</u></strong>.</mark> Afterschool programs are engaging children and youth in STEM learning, including children and youth who may not otherwise be selected to, or choose to, participate in STEM programs. <u>They provide a different mode of intervention—one that allows matching learning experiences to students’ interests and facilitates project-based learning that drives home the relevance and importance of STEM in our daily lives. <strong><mark>They give young people the opportunity to learn through solving problems and through failing— an element crucial to research, experimentation and innovation; science and engineering fields require persistence in the face of failure to solve the world’s problems</u>.</strong></mark> Additionally, mentoring and exposure to role models—key components of afterschool—are particularly effective in engaging youth of color. <u>High-quality <mark>afterschool STEM learning programs</mark> are <mark>hav</mark>ing <mark>significant impact on</mark> the young people <mark>who participate</mark>.

Establish a pilot program during the hours after school that brings STEM education to populations who are currently underrepresented in the STEM fields.</p><p>A recent PCAST report iii recommended developing an initiative for a wide range of high-quality STEM-based afterschool programs spanning several agencies and focused on creating opportunities for inspiration through experiences outside the classroom. <u><strong><mark>Congress should authorize a competitive grant program, based on best practices, that supports afterschool STEM programs and utilizes appropriate outcome and quality indicators</u></strong></mark>. <u>This program should reflect efforts to maximize federal investments in STEM education across federal agencies—an undertaking that Capitol Hill, the White House, and the STEM and afterschool communities support</u>. <u><strong>Student populations that need the most help should be served by the initiative, and it should build on the successes of other federal afterschool investments</u></strong>, such as the 21st Century Community Learning Center initiative. The effort should also support professional development for providers, and be subject to evaluation and research to inform strategies for encouraging more traditionally underrepresented populations to pursue study and careers in the STEM fields.</p><p><u><strong>2. Policy makers should recognize the role afterschool programs play in STEM education and explicitly support them in K-12 STEM education initiatives and legislation.

While these settings and programs play a central role in effective STEM education, afterschool and summer learning programs can foster increased interest and success in STEM disciplines and build STEM literacy</u>. School and classroom resources that support STEM education should be also accessible to afterschool program providers and staff, and <u><strong><mark>federal</u></strong></mark> and state <u><strong><mark>STEM education initiatives should explicitly cite afterschool as a strategy to improve the teaching and learning of STEM disciplines in legislative and regulatory guidance</u></strong></mark>. These public funds should be invested in promoting stronger partnerships between classroom teachers and afterschool providers; joint professional development with afterschool educators; and teacher training programs that recognize the value of the afterschool setting by allowing practicum, placements, etc. in afterschool/summer programs. <u>A number of existing federally-funded afterschool programs could provide some level of support for STEM education. While the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program is the only exclusive and substantial federal funding source for afterschool, before-school and summer learning programs, other agencies— such as the Department of Justice, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development—invest in afterschool programs that could help support STEM learning</u>.

Yet numerous educational research studies have indicated that <u><mark>students’ interest and motivation toward STEM learning has declined</u></mark> especially in western countries and more prosperous Asian nations (Thomas and Watters). Concern for improving STEM education in many nations continues to grow as <u>demand for STEM skills to <strong>meet economic challenges</strong> increasingly becomes acute</u> (English 2016; Marginson et al. 2013; NAE and NRC 2014). Driven by genuine or perceived current and future shortages in the STEM workforce, many education systems and policy makers around the globe are preoccupied with advancing competencies in STEM domains. However, the views on the nature and development of proficiencies in STEM education are diverse, and increased focus on integration raises new concerns and needs for further research (English 2016; Marginson et al. 2013).</p><p>Although the idea of STEM education has been contemplated since the 1990s in the USA, few teachers seemed to know how to operationalize STEM education several decades later. <u>Americans realized the country may <strong>fall behind in the global economy</strong> and began to heavily focus on STEM </u>education and careers (Friedman 2005). <u>STEM funding for research and ed</u>ucation then <u>increased</u> significantly in the USA (Sanders 2009). The urgency to improve achievement in American Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education is evident by the massive educational reforms that have occurred in the last two decades within these STEM education disciplines (AAAS 1989, 1993; ABET 2004; ITEA 1996, 2000, 2002, 2007; NCTM 1989, 2000; NRC 1989, 1994, 1996, 2012). Although these various documents seek to leverage best practices in education informed by research on how people learn (NRC 2000a, 2000b), [End Page 1] competing theories and agendas may have added confusion to the complexity of integrating STEM subjects. Recent reforms such as Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (NGSS Lead States 2013) and Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers 2010) advocate for purposefully integrating STEM by providing deeper connections among the STEM domains. One of the most recent NAE and NRC (2014) documents, STEM Integration in K-12 Education: Status, Prospects, and an Agenda for Research, recognize problems with competing agendas, lack of coherent effort, and locating and teaching intersections for STEM integration. The Committee on Integrated STEM Education was charged to assist STEM education stakeholders by (a) carefully identifying and characterizing existing approaches to integrated STEM education, (b) review evidence of impact on student learning, and (c) help determine priorities for research on integrated STEM education. This report was created as a way to move STEM educators forward by creating a common language of STEM integration for research and practice. This effort indicates that <u>further work remains to improve STEM integration in practice and establishes a need to conduct more research on integrated STEM education</u> (NAE and NRC 2014).</p><p><u><mark>One outcome of improving achievement in STEM education in many countries is preparing a workforce that will <strong>improve national economies</strong> and <strong>sustain leadership</strong> within the constantly shifting and expanding globalized economy</u></mark>. Wang, Moore, Roehrig, and Park (2011) stated that:</p><p>Growing concern about developing America’s future scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians to remain viable and competitive in the global economy has re-energized attention to STEM education. <u><strong><mark>To remain competitive in a growing global economy, it is imperative that we raise student’s achievement in STEM subjects</u></strong></mark>.

At the most elementary level, <u><mark>the spillover effect is a matter of economics</mark>: the costs of care to the uninsured in emergency and urgent care settings are mostly uncompensated and must be absorbed with public and/or private redistributions of funds</u>. Among hospitals in California, where <u><mark>we focus our analysis</u></mark>, the cost of providing care to the uninsured prior to ACA accounted for 3% to 7% of total operating costs annually, <u><mark>with county hospitals and community clinics</u></mark> incurring the largest revenue losses (California Healthcare Foundation 2010). <u><mark>In order to <strong>reduce</strong> the costs of <strong>uncompensated care</strong> provided to the uninsured, healthcare <strong>providers</strong></mark> may try to <mark>lower their exposure</mark> to an uninsured population <mark>by reducing, <strong>dropping</strong>, or redistributing staff and services <strong>disproportionally used</strong> by the <strong>uninsured</strong>, such as emergency care or substance abuse care</u></mark> (Brown and Stevens 2006; Cunningham, Bazzoli, and Katz 2008). Providers might also attempt to generate or expand services targeted to the insured, shift costs to the insured by increasing fees, or attempt to otherwise alter the insurance status composition of their patient pool in order to gain access to state and federal funds. <u><mark>These provider <strong>strategies</strong> affect access to healthcare, <strong>quality of care</strong>, and <strong>trust in healthcare providers</strong> for <strong>all members of a community</strong></mark>, not just the uninsured</u> (Gresenz and Escarce 2011; Pagán, Balasubramanian, and Pauly 2007; Pagán and Pauly 2006; Pauly and Pagán 2007). Additionally, <u>provider strategies to reduce exposure to the uninsured may have real consequences for the individual health outcomes of the insured</u>. While research by McMorrow (2013) has found inconsistent effects of uninsurance rate on the insured across some health outcomes, Daysal (2012) finds that California hospitals servicing a higher proportion of uninsured patients have 3% to 5% higher mortality following myocardial infarction among insured patients compared with hospitals servicing fewer uninsured patients, controlling for individual health status and past diagnoses. Similarly, Escarce, Edgington, and Gresenz (2014) find that a higher uninsurance rate has an adverse effect on the probability that insured adults with hypertension receive antihypertensive treatment and achieve blood pressure control. Beyond Health Effects? <u>Given the <strong>strain</strong> that <strong>uninsurance</strong> places on individuals, providers, and healthcare markets, <mark>the consequences </mark>of uninsurance <mark>are likely</mark> to go <strong><mark>beyond</strong></mark> health and <mark>healthcare and impact the</mark> <strong><mark>social lives of individuals and communities</u></strong></mark>. In a 2003 report on community levels of uninsurance, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) acknowledged that in addition to thinking about the economic effects of uninsurance, researchers also needed to consider how <u><strong>uninsurance</u></strong> might “<u><strong>strain</u></strong> <u>social relationships among <strong>community members</strong> and <strong>local institutions</u></strong>” (IOM 2003:133). Research on the social spillover effects of uninsurance remains in its infancy and has yet to present a clear or consistent theoretical framework. Our first aim in this paper is thus to bring together research in this area, distill the key pathways of influence, and link them to the sociological literature. <u>Researchers examining links between uninsurance and community social life tend to highlight one of two pathways of influence: (1) <strong>higher burdens</strong> of uncompensated care generate <strong>competing interests</strong> and goals within a community, which<mark> contributes to the <strong>breakdown</strong></mark> <mark>of <strong>social cohesiveness</strong></mark>, <strong>trust</strong>, and <strong>reciprocity</strong> among community members; and (2) <strong><mark>higher costs</strong></mark> <mark>to the uninsured</mark> and their families <mark>contribute to</mark> <strong><mark>increased </mark>social and economic <mark>inequality</strong></mark>, <mark>which promotes</mark> class differentiation, <strong>social distance</strong>, and <strong><mark>community disengagement</u></strong></mark> (see Figure 1). We develop these two theories in more detail below. Competing interests and institutions. Much of the existing literature examining social spillovers of uninsurance focuses on the emergence of competing interests and institutions in communities experiencing high or very high levels of uninsurance. Since communities vary in the number of uninsured and have different resources at their disposal (Cunningham 2007), <u>communities may adopt different strategies of resource allocation in order to absorb the costs of providing healthcare to the uninsured. While some communities may attempt to raise new funds to cover the uninsured (e.g., through taxation), other communities may attempt to redistribute existing funds or services. </u>Yet, as Brown and Stevens (2006) observe, “<u><strong>improving coverage</strong> and care for the uninsured is inescapably an exercise in redistribution from the haves to the have-nots”</u> (p. 151), <u>and <mark>the <strong>interests</strong> of the uninsured are often <strong>pitted against</strong> those of other groups in political battles over budgets</u></mark>. <u>Additionally, attempts to cover the uninsured through redistribution of new or existing funds may run into political barriers or be forced to compete with other public services, such as education and law enforcement (Brown and Stevens 2006).</u> <u><mark>Such <strong>contentious trade-offs</u></strong> <u>between healthcare and</u></mark> other public <u><mark>services</u></mark> may <u><strong><mark>undermine residents’ feelings</u></strong> <u>of</u> <u><strong>connection to a community</u></strong>, <u>mutual <strong>trust</u></strong>, <u>and <strong>collective efficacy</u></strong></mark> (Browning et al. 2008), or perceptions that community members can and will intervene to effectively address common local social and economic problems (Sampson, Raudebusch, and Earls 1997). As Brown and Stevens (2006) demonstrate through their case studies of programs intended to expand coverage to the uninsured in Birmingham, Alabama, and Alameda County (Oakland), California, <u>debates around the provision of care for the uninsured may become even more contentious when they intersect with racial and class divides that have historically limited access to insurance and healthcare institutions among African Americans and Latinos</u>. In communities where local government and the private sector have failed to adequately cover the uninsured, local institutions, such as churches and schools, may develop their own programs to address the needs of the uninsured with varying success (Timmermans, Orrico, and Smith 2014). Thus, while <u><strong><mark>healthcare access</u></strong></mark> may <u><mark>become a <strong>rallying point for social mobilization in </u></strong></mark>some<u><strong> <mark>communities</u></strong></mark> (Steinberg and Baxter 1998), the literature above suggests that <u><strong><mark>high</mark> community <mark>levels of uninsurance</u></strong></mark> may also <u>decrease effectiveness and support of local government</u>, <u><strong><mark>decrease</u></strong></mark> <u><mark>residents’ feelings of <strong></mark>cohesiveness</u></strong> <u>and</u> <u><strong><mark>collective efficacy</u></strong></mark>, <u>and generate perceptions that local institutions <strong>are not serving</strong> the needs of residents</u>. <u>Social and economic inequality. A second pathway through which <strong>uninsurance</strong> has been found to affect social life is via the <strong>exacerbation</strong> of <strong>social and economic inequality</u></strong>. Research by Kaplan and colleagues (1996) suggests that levels of <u><mark>uninsurance may contribute to <strong>stratification</strong> and <strong>income inequality</strong> within a community</u></mark>. Most directly, <u>uninsured individuals and families pay higher out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare, aggravating existing inequalities in income and wealth among community residents</u> (IOM 2003; Seifert and Rukavina 2006). At the neighborhood level, <u><strong>higher levels of income inequality</u></strong> <u>are associated with <strong>lower levels of civic engagement and trust</u></strong> <u>among residents</u> (Kawachi et al. 1997). As stratification scholars have demonstrated (Schwartz and Mare 2005), <u>status distinctions become <strong>starker</u></strong> and more socially meaningful <u>as inequality increases</u>, <u>making it</u> more <u><strong>difficult</u></strong> <u>for individuals to form and maintain <strong>social relationships</u></strong> across status groups. Additionally, <u>due to <strong>strong links</u></strong> <u>between</u> <u><strong>private health insurance</u></strong> <u>and</u> <u><strong>full-time</u></strong>, nonmenial <u><strong>employment</u></strong> and between public programs for the uninsured and lower-quality care, health insurance constitutes both a marker of social status as well as a nonmaterial asset that stratifies residents within communities on the basis of their access to healthcare. Kim, Haney, and Hutchinson (2012) examine the effects of exclusion from healthcare among Korean Americans, one of the most highly uninsured population groups among Asian Americans. In their qualitative investigation, the authors find not only that <u>exclusion from healthcare has effects on individual health behaviors and healthcare seeking but also that uninsured individuals experience a sense of <strong>devaluation</strong> relative to other U.S. citizens</u>. <u>In twin top-down and bottom-up processes</u>, <u><strong><mark>exclusion</u></strong></mark> and disenfranchisement <u><mark>by</u></mark> the state and <u><mark>healthcare </mark>institutions <mark>foster</u></mark> <u><strong><mark>avoidance</u></strong></mark> and feelings of <u><strong>disconnection</u></strong>, <u><strong><mark>discouragement</u></strong></mark>, <u><mark>and</u></mark> <u><strong><mark>resentment </strong>at the<strong> bottom</u></strong></mark>. Becker (2004, 2007) and Horton (2004) take this premise further in their multiple analyses of healthcare exclusion of uninsured ethnic minorities and immigrant groups in the United States. Becker’s work in particular repeatedly suggests that individuals and groups that are excluded from the U.S. healthcare system because they are uninsured or underinsured with high-deductible, catastrophic plans frequently experience poorer-quality care, discrimination, and depersonalization when they do seek care, which respondents view as an assault on their personal dignity. Other recent research on how being uninsured negatively affects patient–provider interactions and potential future interactions supports these findings (Allen et al. 2014). Implied in each of these works is the IOM’s (2003) notion that access to healthcare and health insurance are part of an implicit social contract between employers and workers and between the state and citizens. <u>The <mark>lack of <strong>uninsurance</u></strong></mark> “<u><mark>represents a <strong>breach</u></strong></mark> <u><mark>of</u></mark> that <u><strong><mark>social contract</u></strong></mark>” and, <u><mark>when</u></mark> “<u><mark>experienced by <strong>large numbers</u></strong></mark> of individuals <u><mark>in a community</u></mark>, <u><mark>may</u></mark> <u><strong><mark>erode the social bonds</u></strong></mark> <u><mark>that <strong>define and nurture</u></strong></mark> <u><mark>functioning</u></mark>, <u><strong><mark>healthy communities</u></strong></mark>, <u>as uninsured persons are made aware of their lesser claim on services and resources that are generally valued as essential to a dignified and secure life</u>” (IOM 2003:133). Phrased another way by Faden and Powers (1999): In addition to the stress, powerlessness and social disrespect that have been shown to be associated with poorer health status, [uninsured individuals’] awareness of their disadvantaged social status has the potential to undermine selfrespect and their sense of themselves as the moral equals of the more fortunate members of society. (P. 3) At the same time, <u><strong>the converse can also be observed</u></strong>: <u>where</u> local municipalities and state <u><strong>governments</u></strong> <u>have made a <strong>concerted</strong> effort toward <strong>including marginal populations</u></strong> <u>into</u> the <u>healthcare</u> system, various kinds of respondents—marginalized <u><strong>populations</u></strong>, service providers, and city officials—<u>describe</u> these <u>reforms as </u>important not just for providing access to care but are <u><strong>motivated</u></strong> <u>by broader</u> concerns around <u><strong>fostering connectedness</u></strong>, <u><strong>collaboration</u></strong>, <u>and</u> <u><strong>feelings of a shared fate</u></strong> (Marrow 2012; Marrow and Joseph 2015). Moreover, in some healthcare settings, the provision of supportive, consistent, and nonjudgmental <u><strong>care</u></strong> <u>has been shown to promote</u> <u>feelings of <strong>belonging</u></strong>, <u><strong>dignity</u></strong>, <u>and <strong>self-efficacy</u></strong> <u>among marginalized patients</u> (Timmermans and McKay 2009). Thus, like inequalities in wealth and income, <u><strong>inequality</u></strong> <u>in</u> <u><strong>access to health insurance</u></strong> and healthcare may <u>contribute to <strong>national</u></strong> and local processes of <u><strong>identity formation</u></strong>, class differentiation, <u>and <strong>social distance</u></strong>; at the same time, <u><mark>efforts </mark>to reform healthcare</u> <u><strong><mark>toward universal access</u></strong></mark> and quality may <u><strong><mark>improve feelings of belonging and connectedness</u></strong></mark> <u><mark>among</u></mark> <u>previously <strong><mark>excluded</strong> groups</u></mark>.</p></p></div>\n<h2>Advantage 3 Impact</h2>\n<div><p>Food insecurity, driven by climate change and breakdown in agricultural systems, leads to conflict, mass migration, economic shocks, institutional failure, and societal collapse, creating an existential risk to human civilization as outlined in a 2021 study by Cambridge University engineering researchers.

Within this period, <u>approximately half of the evidence points cover a scale of less than one decade and the other half a scale of greater than one decad</u>e. Approximately half of the evidence points conduct analyses at yearly granularity and the other half conduct analyses at granularity greater than one year, with only a few studies conducting analyses at monthly granularity. The spatial scale and granularity of study varies across the evidence base. <u>Approximately one third of the evidence points investigate the system at a global scale, with the remaining two thirds focusing on regional or national scales, <strong>primarily in Africa as well as the Middle East and Asia.</u></strong> Approximately half of the evidence points analyse the causal pathway at sub-national granularity, with the other half primarily focusing on national-level granularity. This variation provided different coverage of the complex relationships within the system, which was informative for constructing our CLD. The distribution of data-driven methods used across the evidence base is notably different for each societal collapse proxy<u>. Evidence points for natural mortality mostly use collection/ analysis of interview/survey data. This is likely because the <mark>minimum</mark> daily <mark>food intake</mark> for human survival <mark>is well established</mark> (FAO 2004); as such, statistical analysis of food and mortality data sets would not yield significantly new insights into thresholds whereas interviews/surveys can provide insight into an individual’s circumstances influencing this relationship.</u> Evidence points for conflict mortality mostly use statistical analysis of existing datasets. This likely reflects the interest in rigorously curated conflict datasets, such as UCDP/ PRIO (2019), across the conflict and peace fields. Evidence points for emigration mostly use collection/analysis of interview/survey data, likely because this provides nuanced insight into an individual’s decision to migrate. It may also be due to data availability and quality challenges that limit quantitative statistical analyses, which are being addressed by groups such as IOM GMDAC (2019). <u>Amongst these data challenges, it is<mark> important to recognise</mark> the issue of reconciling <mark>different types of </mark>voluntary and forced <mark>migration with causal drivers</mark>, given the complex social, economic and political factors at play; this challenge similarly applies to the other societal collapse proxies but is particularly noted in the migration studies</u>. We observe from these studies that <u>a <mark>food insecurity threshold</mark> for natural mortality <strong><mark>is well established</strong> but thresholds for conflict mortality and emigration are not</mark>.</u> Indeed, distinguishing causal drivers within datasets and defining quantitative thresholds for these determinants remains a ‘grand challenge’ (Kintigh et al. 2014). Each data-driven method offers different advantages. The complex systems models each describe ‘chunks’ of the system at different scale and granularity. The models provide mathematical definition, are calibrated to real-world data and enable quantitative simulation of key relationships in the system. The statistical analyses quantitatively examine relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables within the system, which can be used as a mathematical basis for extending modelling capabilities. The collection/ analysis of interview/survey data provides insight into qualitative aspects of human perspective and decision-making that quantitative data sets cannot provide directly. The data-led case study/scenarios combine quantitative data with qualitative expert interpretation to better understand global trends and forecasts. These latter two methods can also be used to inform the development of modelling capabilities, the scenarios analysed by such models and their application in decision-making processes. Collectively, these different data-driven methods can yield useful insights into the nuances of relationships in the system of interest. 4.2 Causal loop diagram of the climate change, <u><strong>food insecurity and societal collapse</u></strong> in contemporary society at global scale and national granularity The main result of this paper is the CLD (the f-CLD from Section 3, Step V), presented in Fig. 5. <u>It structures the relationships between climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse</u> as described in our new empirical evidence base (presented in Fig. 4 and discussed in Section 4.1.). We discuss three key aspects of the CLD, namely insights related to the spread of empirical evidence, the qualitative complex system depicted, and quantitative complex system modelling, below, alongside consideration of well-established benefits and limitations of CLDs. Our CLD is presented in a novel format that documents the spread of our empirical evidence base. We use line thickness and colour, respectively, to depict the density and type of the data-driven methods used by the empirical evidence points to analyse a given link between two variables. Doing this aids comprehension of where existing work has been focused with respect to the climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway. It may also help with the identification of gaps in existing analyses. For example, we can see that <u>the link between food insecurity and conflict has been investigated mostly by evidence points using statistical analyses</u> (blue), <u>whereas the links between food insecurity and migration, and food insecurity and natural mortality, have been investigated mostly by evidence points using interviews/ surveys</u> (green). This hints that it may be useful to investigate the former using quantitative statistics, and the latter using qualitative interviews/surveys, to gain further insights offered by the different data-driven methods as described in Section 4.1. It is important to recognise that our CLD may show negligible density for important links or even be missing important variables and/or links, either because they have not yet been studied or because our key word search failed to identify evidence points that have studied them. For example, our study focused on the climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway, so the density of our empirical evidence is concentrated along links central to this pathway; whereas, the links between peripheral variables in the system, such as between fertility and births, show a lower density of empirical evidence. Similarly, our use of the population loss set of societal collapse proxies means that the evidence base details natural mortality, conflict mortality and emigration; whereas, the institutional breakdown set are not detailed. In considering this issue, our methodology attempted to maximise the rigour and transparency of our study by documenting the spread of our empirical evidence base to help make the reader aware of exactly how much and what type of evidence was supporting the CLD presented here. Further, we can see that while <u><mark>empirical studies have linked climate change via <strong>food insecurity to our societal collapse</mark> </strong>proxies of natural mortality, conflict mortality and emigration</u>, we found no empirical studies linking these proxies to the explicit term of societal collapse. This was expected given the motivation of this study (Section 1) and is due to the fact that there are no contemporary events of societal collapse, under the same definition as those in the historical studies pre-dating contemporary society, that enable these links to be empirically studied (Beard et al. 2020). Having considered the spread of empirical evidence, we now consider the complex system documented. A key benefit of CLDs is that they simply present a myriad of information in a single diagram; in doing so, CLDs enable comprehension of the structure and behaviour of complex systems, including feedbacks, intervention points and far-reaching interdependencies (Sterman 2011). Our CLD visually depicts a system of 39 variables, 105 links and 32,000 feedback loops,1 integrating information from different fields including climate science, food security, conflict, migration and health research. Walking through the CLD at a high-level, we can see how population growth and lifestyle emissions, influenced by institutional/demographic factors (e.g. emission reduction incentives), combine to directly drive climate change. Similarly, they indirectly drive climate change via consumer demand on food production, which produces emissions directly (e.g. ruminant livestock) and indirectly via industrial capital/output (e.g. processing factories). <u>The environmental risk factors (e.g. extreme weather events) of climate change may cause losses of food production either directly (e.g. plant disease) or indirectly via agricultural input availability (e.g. loss of water source for irrigation).</u> A <u>country’s food availability is influenced by domestic food production and international food trade.</u> Food accessibility is influenced by its food price, which responds to domestic (e.g. cost of food production and distribution) and international (e.g. international food price) markets, and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food subsidies). Food utilization is influenced by infrastructure/services (e.g. education) and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural traditions). Food insecurity is underpinned by these three pillars of food availability, food accessibility and food utilization. <u>For a given country</u>, <u><strong><mark>food insecurity can drive natural mortality</u></strong></mark> (i.e. starvation<u>), <mark>conflict<strong> and migration</mark>, contributing to population loss, as well as <mark>economic shocks and socio-political instability,</u></strong> <u>contributing to institutional breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of <strong>societal collapse</u></strong></mark>. Beyond a given country suffering increased natural mortality, famines (<u>i.e.</u> <u>food</u> <u><strong>insecurity</u></strong>) <u>can place</u> <u><strong>pressure</u></strong> <u>on</u> <u><strong>international humanitarian efforts</u></strong> (i.e. institutional risk factors). <u><strong><mark>Conflict</u></strong> <u>may occur</u> <u><strong>domestically</u></strong> <u>or</u> <u><strong>internationally</u></strong> <u>and can</u> <u><strong>feedback</u></strong> <u>to <strong>exacerbate</u></strong></mark> food <u><strong><mark>insecurity</u></strong> <u>and <strong>institutional fragility</u></strong></mark> (i.e. institutional risk factors). Potential <u>mass</u> <u><strong><mark>emigration</u></strong> <u>can increase pressure on food availability,</mark> natural resources and infrastructure/services in the</u> <u><strong>destination</u></strong> nation, <u><mark>which can lead to</u> <u><strong>socio-cultural tensions</u></strong></mark> (i.e. institutional risk factors) <u><mark>that</u> <u><strong>fuel conflict</strong>. Food insecurity can</mark> also <strong>directly</strong> <mark>contribute to</u></mark> institutional risk factors such as <u><strong><mark>social unrest</strong>, <strong>political instability</u></strong> <u>and</u></mark> economic <u><strong><mark>inequality</strong>, which increase the risk of</u> <u><strong>societal collapse</u></strong></mark> <u>due to</u> institutional <u><strong>breakdown</strong>, that</u> may also <u><strong>cascade internationally</u></strong>. While already fragile states are expected to be hit the worst directly, these insights reveal the indirect ramifications of climate change on our globalised society (Kemp 2020), <u>with</u> <u><strong>serious consequences</u></strong> <u>for humanity’s</u> <u><strong>‘existential security’</u></strong> (Sears 2020). <u>While some of these relationships may appear</u> <u><strong>obvious</strong>, it is the act of bringing this information</u>, which may otherwise be siloed and thus preventing consideration of the full story, <u><strong>together</u></strong> in one place <u>that is of value</u> (Sterman 2011). In <u>doing so</u>, our CLD attempts to <u>provide</u> readers with <u>the opportunity to explore the</u> climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse <u>causal pathway, consider</u> <u><strong>worst-case scenarios</u></strong> that we want <u>to avoid, develop</u> <u><strong>transformative narratives</u></strong> <u>of “where we want to go” and think about</u> <u><strong>interventions</u></strong> <u>that may help us attain this desired future</u> (Hinkel et al. 2020).</p></p></div>\n<h2>Solvency Argument</h2>\n<div><p>Expanded School Mental Health programs, supported by federal and state funding coordination, foster positive school climates and enhance student mental health and social-emotional skills, increasing positive academic behaviors and tackling low academic self-concept harms from detracking reforms, proving the plan\'s solvency.</p></div>\n<h2>Solvency Card</h2>\n<div><h4>Establishing Expanded School Mental Health programs are necessary to provide care that takes into the student’s life experiences and promote a positive learning environment.</h4><p><strong>Elizabeth Freeman, clinical mental health therapist writes in 2011:</strong> – School mental health sustainability: Funding strategies to build sustainable school mental health programs.
